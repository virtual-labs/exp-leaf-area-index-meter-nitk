Leaf area lndex (LAI) is a dimensionless measure that portrays plant canopies. It is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area in broadleaf canopies. LAI is an intricate variable that relates not exclusively to the size of the canopy, yet additionally to its density, and the orientation of the leaves to the light sources. Also, LAI shifts with seasonal changes in plant action, and is peaked in the spring when new leaves are being delivered and least in pre-fall or late-summer when leaves senesce (and possibly shed).

The camera has an advanced MOS sensor with 16 million image pixels gives you more speed, quality, and clarity than a traditional CCD or CMOS sensor with multiple Viewing Modes: Ring, Dome, Front &deg;/Rear 180 &deg;, 360 &deg; Panorama, Globe. It Captures all the high-speed action with 1080p full-HD video or full-res images in 10fps with a push of a button. It has Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity so that we set the camera where you want it and take your phone with you to call the shots anytime with the Camera-based App on your iOS/Android device.

There is no ideal approach to gauge LAI. Every strategy has benefits and drawbacks. Below are few methods of LAI Estimation:

**Direct Measurement:**  
Generally, analysts estimated the leaf area index by gathering each leaf from a plot and carefully estimating the area of each leaf. Present day equipment like flatbed scanners have made this process more efficient, yet it is still tedious and destructive. In tall forest coverings, it may not be feasible. But however it remains the most precise technique for computing leaf area index as every individual leaf is measured physically. Litter traps are another  direct approach to gauge LAI, however they don't function admirably in evergreen canopies and can just collect information from  Plant parts that are removed due to aging and unnecessary plant parts are removed for better growth of the plant.

**Indirect Measurement:**   
Quite a few years prior, researchers started to search for better approaches to gauge LAI, both to save time and to abstain from obliterating the environments they were attempting to quantify. These indirect techniques derive LAI from estimations of related factors, for example, the measure of light that is communicated through or reflected by a canopy.


**Hemispherical photography:**  
Hemispherical photography was one of the main techniques used to indirectly gauge leaf area Index. Photographs were originally analyzed by researchers themselves. Now, most researchers use specialized software to analyze images and differentiate between vegetated and non-vegetated pixels.
